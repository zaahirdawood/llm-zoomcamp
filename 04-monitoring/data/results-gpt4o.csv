2. **Inversion of Matrices**: Be cautious if you attempt to invert a matrix multiple times. If you have already computed the inverse of a matrix in your code, doing it again may lead to a singular matrix error.

3. **Matrix Dimensions**: Ensure that when you are performing matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. This is essential for valid multiplication.

"To read a dataset with Pandas in Windows when your code doesn't work, it's important to note that Windows uses backslashes (\) for file paths, which can cause issues in Python because the backslash is also used for escape sequences. 

If you encounter problems with your code, instead of using:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('C:\Users\username\Downloads\data.csv')
```
you should add an ""r"" before the file path to treat it as a raw string, which prevents any escape sequence interpretation. The correct code should look like this:

The problem with using the backslash is that in Python, the '\' has a purpose known as an escape sequence. Escape sequences allow us to include special characters in strings, for example, ""\n"" to add a new line or ""\t"" to add spaces, etc. To avoid the issue we just need to add ""r"" before the file path and Python will treat it as a literal string (not an escape sequence).

(Added by Wesley Barreto)",b6730228,"If I invert a matrix and multiply by the original, why don't I get an exact identity matrix?",machine-learning-zoomcamp
"The matrices do not return an exact identity after multiplication due to floating point precision issues in computer arithmetic. When you multiply an inverse of a matrix by the original matrix, you might expect to get an identity matrix. However, because floating point math is not perfectly precise, the result can include very small errors, resulting in values close to, but not exactly, the expected identity matrix. For example, the output may show values like ""1.00000000e+00"" alongside very small numbers close to zero rather than a perfect identity matrix.","I was doing Question 7 from Week1 Homework and with step6: Invert XTX, I created the inverse. Now, an inverse when multiplied by the original matrix should return in an Identity matrix. But when I multiplied the inverse with the original matrix, it gave a matrix like this:

"You can filter a dataset using multiple conditions with logical operators in Pandas. For example, to filter based on the ""ocean_proximity"" column for multiple conditions, you can use the following syntax:

```python
df = df[(df[""ocean_proximity""] == ""<1H OCEAN"") | (df[""ocean_proximity""] == ""INLAND"")]
```

In this example, the `|` operator is used for the logical OR condition. Alternatively, you can use the `isin()` method for a cleaner approach:

```python
df = df[df['ocean_proximity'].isin(['<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND'])]
```

These methods allow you to filter the dataset according to your criteria effectively.","We can filter a dataset by using its values as below.
df = df[(df[""ocean_proximity""] == ""<1H OCEAN"") | (df[""ocean_proximity""] == ""INLAND"")]

A sign that a model has overfitted the training data is when the accuracy and the loss are both still the same or nearly the same while training. This suggests that the model is not able to learn from the training data and is possibly memorizing it without generalizing well to new data.,"Q: “In lesson 2.8 why is y_pred different from y? After all, we trained X_train to get the weights that when multiplied by X_train should give exactly y, or?”

In contrast, a distribution with a long tail has a few observations with high values, leading to an asymmetrical shape where the area is not the same on each side. This causes the mean, median, and mode to be different, making the mean less representative of the data. Additionally, the range of values in a distribution with a long tail is larger, and the probability of observations occurring on the left side versus the right side is also unequal.","One of the most important characteristics of the normal distribution is that mean=median=mode, this means that the most popular value, the mean of the distribution and 50% of the sample are under the same value, this is equivalent to say that the area under the curve (black) is the same on the left and on the right. The long tail (red curve) is the result of having a few observations with high values, now the behaviour of the distribution changes, first of all, the area is different on each side and now the mean, median and mode are different. As a consequence, the mean is no longer representative, the range is larger than before and the probability of being on the left or on the right is not the same.

1. Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using the `mean_squared_error` function from the `sklearn.metrics` library, which requires the actual and predicted values as inputs.
   
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
   
   mse = mean_squared_error(actual_values, predicted_values)
   ```

2. Take the square root of the MSE to obtain the RMSE.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
   print(""Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):"", rmse)
   ```

Alternatively, you can directly use the `mean_squared_error` function with the `squared` parameter set to `False`, which will return the RMSE without needing to calculate the square root separately:

```python
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_actual, y_predicted, squared=False)
```

This method provides a straightforward way to calculate the RMSE using just the `sklearn` library.","The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is one of the primary metrics to evaluate the performance of a regression model. It calculates the average deviation between the model's predicted values and the actual observed values, offering insight into the model's ability to accurately forecast the target variable.

```python
df = df[(df[""condition1""]) | (df[""condition2""])]  # OR
df = df[(df[""condition1""]) & (df[""condition2""])]  # AND

You can also use the `isin` method for filtering, like this:

```python
df = df[df['column_name'].isin(['value1', 'value2'])]

-Mohammad Emad Sharifi-",1091b10f,How do I apply one-hot encoding to a column with car brands?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"One example of using pandas for one-hot encoding is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])
```

In this code, `pd.get_dummies()` creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.","The error message “could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead. In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand ‘Nissan’ into a numerical value, which isn’t possible.
To resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.
Here’s an example of how you can perform one-hot encoding using pandas:
import pandas as pd
# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])

"Mutual information score is used only for categorical or discrete variables because it specifically calculates the relationship between such variables.

So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1.

"Changing the `median_house_value` to binary format affects its values by converting them from continuous to discrete. Specifically, it transforms the continuous values into either 0 or 1. This binary format allows for the calculation of the mutual information score, which is only applicable to categorical or discrete variables.

Combine Features: After 	normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder, combine them to form a single feature matrix (X_train). This combined dataset serves as the input for training the Ridge regression model.
By following these steps, you can address convergence errors and enhance the stability of your Ridge model training process. It's important to note that the choice of encoding method, such as OneHotEncoder, is appropriate for handling categorical features in this context.

"The benefits of using a sparse matrix instead of a dense matrix include:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: A sparse matrix only stores the non-zero values and their positions in memory, making it more memory-efficient, especially when working with large datasets that have many zero or missing values.

2. **Performance**: Training models using a sparse matrix can be more performant compared to using a dense matrix.

"To determine the correct RMSE score, you need to calculate RMSE for each parameter being evaluated. If you have multiple RMSE scores, select the lowest one. This process is essential when tuning models, as it helps to identify the best performing model or parameter settings. 

For calculating RMSE, you can use libraries such as `numpy` and `sklearn`. Here is a common method:

1. Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using `mean_squared_error` from `sklearn.metrics`.
2. Take the square root of the MSE to get the RMSE.

Here’s a code example:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

mse = mean_squared_error(actual_values, predicted_values)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
print(""Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):"", rmse)
```

Alternatively, you can directly get RMSE without using `np.sqrt()` by setting the `squared` parameter to `False`:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

rms = mean_squared_error(y_actual, y_predicted, squared=False)
```

This will return the RMSE directly.","Question: Regarding RMSE, how do we decide on the correct score to choose? In the study group discussion    about week two homework, all of us got it wrong and one person had the lowest score selected as well.

"The key differences between the input/output types of pandas get_dummies and sklearn OneHotEncoder are:

1. **Input Type**: pandas get_dummies works directly with Pandas DataFrames, while sklearn OneHotEncoder typically requires an array as input.
   
2. **Output Type**: The output of get_dummies is a DataFrame, which is convenient for data analysis within Pandas, whereas OneHotEncoder can produce output in different formats, including dense or sparse matrices, depending on the specified parameters.

3. **Handling of Missing Values**: The methods also differ in how they handle missing values, which may not be addressed in detail here but is a consideration in their respective functionalities. 

Both techniques result in identical outcomes when one-hot-encoding categorical variables; the choice between them often depends on the context in which they are used, such as using get_dummies for easier DataFrame manipulation and OneHotEncoder for use in scikit-learn pipelines.","They are basically the same.

"To obtain precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy simultaneously in your classification task, you can use the `classification_report` function from the Scikit-learn library. This function provides a comprehensive report that includes all these metrics. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Assuming y_val are true labels and y_pred are predicted labels
report = classification_report(y_val, y_pred)
print(report)
```

Additionally, if you prefer to calculate each metric separately, you can use the following code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_val, y_pred)

The error message states: ""This solver needs samples of at least 2 classes in the data, but the data contains only one class: 0.""

You can fix this issue by ensuring that your churn column is correctly encoded to include both classes. Currently, your code seems to be set up to only represent 'yes' as 1 and everything else as 0. If there are no 'yes' responses in your data, this will lead to the problem you are encountering.

One way to resolve it is to ensure that your data has a balance between classes.

"The KFold function, when instantiated as KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1), creates a generator object that splits the dataset into 'n_splits' separate pairs of training and validation sets. The 'shuffle' parameter, when set to True, randomizes the data before splitting, and the 'random_state' parameter ensures that this shuffling is reproducible, allowing the same randomization to occur every time the code is run with that specific seed. It is noted that the actual k-fold splitting occurs during the iteration over the generator with the command 'for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train):'.

(Arthur Minakhmetov)
Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop
(Bhaskar Sarma)
In case of KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1) and C= [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], it is better to loop through the different values of Cs as the video explained.

As explained, KFold generates a generator object containing information like n_splits, shuffle, and random_state. The actual k-fold splitting occurs within the for loop that processes the splits, making the placement irrelevant in terms of the final results. It is more efficient from a programming perspective to instantiate KFold before the loop rather than repeatedly inside it.","What does this line do?

"Changing the random_state parameter in KFold affects the results because it influences how the data is shuffled before being split into training and validation sets. Each unique random_state value leads to a different random permutation of the data, resulting in potentially different training/validation splits. This can affect the model's performance and evaluation metrics, as shown when multiple users noted that changing the random_state resulted in different outcomes. Even though the object that generates the splits remains the same, the actual splitting occurs in the subsequent loop, making random_state a critical factor in the reproducibility and variability of the results.","What does this line do?

"The loop should iterate through the different C values because ""C"" is a hyperparameter associated with regularization in models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and logistic regression. Different C values yield different levels of regularization: smaller C values introduce more regularization, potentially underfitting the model, while larger C values reduce regularization, potentially leading to overfitting. By looping through these values, you can evaluate the performance of the model with each configuration and ultimately choose the hyperparameter that provides the best score through cross-validation, which helps in assessing model performance more effectively.","What does this line do?

plt.annotate(f'Optimal Threshold: {optimal_threshold:.2f}\nOptimal F1 Score: {optimal_f1_score:.2f}',
             xy=(optimal_threshold, optimal_f1_score),
             xytext=(0.3, 0.5),
             textcoords='axes fraction',
             arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05))
```

This will display an arrow pointing to the optimal threshold on the graph, along with the corresponding optimal F1 score.","Matplotlib has a cool method to annotate where you could provide an X,Y point and annotate with an arrow and text. For example this will show an arrow pointing to the x,y point optimal threshold.
plt.annotate(f'Optimal Threshold: {optimal_threshold:.2f}\nOptimal F1 Score: {optimal_f1_score:.2f}',
xy=(optimal_threshold, optimal_f1_score),
xytext=(0.3, 0.5),
textcoords='axes fraction',
arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05))
Quinn Avila",bda2c9b3,What is an optimal way to annotate the optimal threshold and F1 score on a graph?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"To annotate a graph in Matplotlib, you need to provide the following parameters:

1. `xy`: The x,y point where you want the annotation to point.
2. `xytext`: The position of the text annotation.
3. `textcoords`: Specifies what coordinate system the `xytext` parameters are in (e.g., 'axes fraction').
4. `arrowprops`: A dictionary specifying the properties of the arrow (e.g., facecolor and shrink).

An example of a Matplotlib annotation would look like this:

"To split data into train, validation, and test sets, it's recommended to follow a ratio of 60% for the train set, 20% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. There are different methods to achieve this, but it's important to avoid data leakage by ensuring that the data from the test set does not influence the training stage. This can be done by executing the splits systematically, for example:

1) You can first split the data into training and a temporary set, and then split the temporary set to create validation and test sets.
   ```python
   df_train, df_temp = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)
   df_val, df_test = train_test_split(df_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

   df_train, df_val = train_test_split(df_full_train, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
   ```

The second method is favored as it ensures more consistency with the expected practices in the lessons and aligns better with the homework requirements.

Make sure that you have “Virtual Machine Platform” feature activated in your Windows “Features”. To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.

Once it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.
You are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.
To go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:
Python should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.

You can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc
You have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.
You can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).

Gopakumar Gopinathan",a4d3b1e5,Why does running 'pipenv install sklearn==1.0.2' give errors during homework?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
The version of sklearn used in the lecture by the facilitator was sklearn==0.24.1.,"When the facilitator was adding sklearn to the virtual environment in the lectures, he used sklearn==0.24.1 and it ran smoothly. But while doing the homework and you are asked to use the 1.0.2 version of sklearn, it gives errors.
The solution is to use the full name of sklearn. That is, run it as “pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2” and the error will go away, allowing you to install sklearn for the version in your virtual environment.

"Docker containers should be run with the `--rm` flag to automatically remove them upon exit. This is considered a best practice because it helps prevent the accumulation of stopped containers, which can consume extra disk space on your system. By using the `--rm` option, you ensure that containers do not linger in a stopped state after they have been run, thus maintaining a cleaner environment and saving storage space.","What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?

They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host.

"If you encounter library installation issues using pipenv, you should verify the following:

1. **Dependency Resolution**: If you receive a `[pipenv.exceptions.ResolutionFailure]: Warning: Your dependencies could not be resolved` message, this indicates that there may be a mismatch in your sub-dependencies. You can try manually changing the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`, and then run the command `pipenv lock` to fix the problem.

2. **Python Version Errors**: If you encounter errors related to `python_version` or `python_full_version`, you should open your `Pipfile`, remove either the `python_version` or `python_full_version` line (but not both), and then run `pipenv lock` to create the updated `Pipfile.lock`.

   - **Downgrade the protobuf package** to version 3.20.x or lower by running the command:
     ```
     pipenv install protobuf==3.20.1

There are two options to fix this:
Re-initialize by running eb init -i and choosing the options from a list (the first default option for docker platform should be fine).

"To fix the error related to Docker platforms in section 5, you need to ensure that you specify the correct platform when building the Docker image. Use the command:

```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t clothing-model .

"Bagging and boosting are two ensemble learning techniques used to improve the performance of machine learning models. 

Bagging, which stands for ""Bootstrap Aggregation,"" involves creating multiple training datasets through sampling with replacement from the original dataset. Each model (such as decision trees in Random Forest) is trained on these different datasets in parallel, and their outputs are combined—either by voting for classification or averaging for regression. This method aims to reduce variance and can help with overfitting.

Boosting, on the other hand, is a sequential approach where each model is trained based on the errors of the previous models. It gives more weight to misclassified observations, allowing subsequent models to focus on correcting those errors. Boosting aims to reduce bias and typically improves accuracy, although it can be more prone to overfitting.

In summary, bagging reduces variance by training models independently in parallel, while boosting reduces bias by training models sequentially and focusing on mistakes.","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

2. **Creating a horizontal bar chart**: To visualize feature importance using a horizontal bar chart, follow these steps:
   - Extract feature importances from the model:
     ```python
     feature_importances = list(zip(features_names, rdr_model.feature_importances_))
     importance_df = pd.DataFrame(feature_importances, columns=['feature_names', 'feature_importances'])

   - Sort the DataFrame by feature importances in descending order:
     ```python
     importance_df = importance_df.sort_values(by='feature_importances', ascending=False)
     ```
   - Create a horizontal bar chart:
     ```python

1. **Model Configuration**: Ensure that you have set the appropriate parameters such as `class_mode='binary'` when reading the data. This can impact the model's training effectiveness.

2. **Optimizer and Hyperparameters**: Using the incorrect optimizer, batch size, or learning rate can lead to stagnation in accuracy and loss. It’s essential to choose suitable values for these hyperparameters to facilitate learning.

3. **Data Augmentation**: If you've recently resumed training after data augmentation and observe a drastic increase in loss (e.g., sky-high loss during the first epoch) and accuracy dropping to around 0.5, check that your `ImageDataGenerator` includes the 'rescale' option as specified in previous steps.

Additionally, enabling operation determinism with `tf.config.experimental.enable_op_determinism()` further supports reproducibility by ensuring that operations yield consistent outcomes across runs. This approach helps maintain the same behavior in your experiments, making it easier to compare results and debug issues.","Reproducibility for training runs can be achieved following these instructions:

\[

"The output shape of a Conv2d layer is derived based on the input dimensions and the parameters of the convolutional layer. For example, if you define a Conv2d layer as follows:

```python
tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3))
```

In this case, the input image has a shape of (150, 150, 3) (width, height, channels). The kernel size is 3x3, and there are 32 filters. 

The output shape for a Conv2d layer can be calculated as follows:

1. The width and height of the output are calculated based on the input size, the kernel size, the stride (default is 1), and the padding (default is 'valid' which means no padding is applied). For an input size of 150 and a kernel size of 3, the output dimensions would be:
   - Output width = (Input width - Kernel width) / Stride + 1 = (150 - 3) / 1 + 1 = 148
   - Output height = (Input height - Kernel height) / Stride + 1 = (150 - 3) / 1 + 1 = 148

2. The number of output channels is equal to the number of filters, which in this case is 32.

Therefore, the output shape of the Conv2d layer is (None, 148, 148, 32) where 'None' represents the batch size which can vary. This is reflected in the `model.summary()` output.","Let’s say we define our Conv2d layer like this:

- The kernel size is \(3 \times 3\).
- The input has 3 channels (RGB).
- We add 1 for the bias term.
- There are 32 filters.

Therefore, the total number of parameters is:

It means our input image is RGB (3 channels, 150 by 150 pixels), kernel is 3x3 and number of filters (layer’s width) is 32.

conv2d (Conv2D)             (None, 148, 148, 32)      896

>>> (3*3*3 +1) * 32
896
# 3x3 kernel, 3 channels RGB, +1 for bias, 32 filters
What about the number of “features” we get after the Flatten layer?

"The main difference between the Sequential and Functional Model API in Keras is that the Sequential Model API allows you to build a model as a simple stack of layers, with each layer having one input tensor and one output tensor. This makes it straightforward to start from an ""empty"" model and add layers in a sequential order. In contrast, the Functional Model API is more advanced, allowing for multiple inputs and outputs, and is often used in scenarios like Transfer Learning where you may need to separate different components of the model. The Functional Model API involves more complex structures, like chained calls of different entities (e.g., ""inputs"", ""base"", ""vectors"", ""outputs"").","It’s quite useful to understand that all types of models in the course are a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor (Sequential model TF page, Sequential class).

This mode is called “Sequential Model API”  (easier)
In Alexey’s videos it is implemented as chained calls of different entities (“inputs”,“base”, “vectors”,  “outputs”) in a more advanced mode “Functional Model API”.
Maybe a more complicated way makes sense when you do Transfer Learning and want to separate “Base” model vs. rest, but in the HW you need to recreate the full model from scratch ⇒ I believe it is easier to work with a sequence of “similar” layers.

"To fix out of memory (OOM) errors in TensorFlow when using an Nvidia GPU, you can try the following steps:

1. Use the following code snippet to set memory growth for the GPU. This allows TensorFlow to allocate memory incrementally instead of pre-allocating all the memory at once:

   ```python
   physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
   try:
       tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
   except:
       # Invalid device or cannot modify virtual devices once initialized.
       pass
   ```

2. If you encounter ""Allocator ran out of memory"" errors, you can also try adding this configuration at the beginning of your notebook:

   ```python
   config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
   config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True

"If you lose the REMOTE_URI variable after the session ends, you will need to set the variable again because it gets lost once the session is terminated.

This will allow you to use it again for logging into the registry.","Solution description
In the unit 9.6, Alexey ran the command echo ${REMOTE_URI} which turned the URI address in the terminal. There workaround is to set a local variable (REMOTE_URI) and assign your URI address in the terminal and use it to login the registry, for instance, REMOTE_URI=2278222782.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/clothing-tflite-images (fake address).

Pay particular attention to the note about adjusting the response in the `lambda_handler()` function to string format to avoid JSON serialization errors.

"To create and push a Docker image for AWS Lambda, start by building your image based on the base AWS Lambda image, such as `FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10`. Once you have built your image, you need to authenticate your Docker client to your Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) and then push the image.

You can authenticate with ECR by using one of the following commands:

1. If you know the region and account ID:
   ```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region <your_region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com
   ```

2. If you have a default region configured:
   ```
   aws ecr get-login-password --region $(aws configure get region) | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ""$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query ""Account"" --output text).dkr.ecr.$(aws configure get region).amazonaws.com""
   ```

After logging in, tag your Docker image with the ECR repository URI and push it to ECR using:
```
docker tag <your_image_name> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com/<your_repository>:<tag>
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com/<your_repository>:<tag>
```

Make sure to replace `<your_image_name>`, `<your_repository>`, `<tag>`, `<aws_account_id>`, and `<your_region>` with your specific details.","The docker image for aws lambda can be created and pushed to aws ecr and the same can be exposed as a REST API through APIGatewayService in a single go using AWS Serverless Framework.

"If you cannot install `tflite_runtime` on your current system, you have several alternatives:

1. **Install Python 3.9:** Since `tflite_runtime` does not work with Python 3.10, you can install Python 3.9, after which you should be able to install `tflite_runtime` without issues.

2. **Check Available Versions:** You can check all available versions of `tflite_runtime` [here](https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/) to find a version compatible with your setup.

3. **Use Options from GitHub:** If you do not find a matching version, you can try out the options available at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite). You can install a specific version with a command similar to:
   ```
   pip install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
   ```

4. **Use TensorFlow's TFLite:** If nothing works, you may consider using the TFLite included in TensorFlow for local development.

5. **Use Docker:** For testing in a Lambda environment, you can use Docker. 

6. **Run a Virtual Machine:** Another option is to run a virtual machine using software like VM VirtualBox with a Linux system. Alternatively, you can use a cloud service such as Vertex AI Workbench on GCP, which provides notebooks and terminals for your tasks.","Problem: When trying to install tflite_runtime with
!pip install --extra-index-url https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ tflite_runtime
one gets an error message above.
Solution:
fflite_runtime is only available for the os-python version combinations that can be found here: https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/
your combination must be missing here
you can see if any of these work for you https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite
and install the needed one using pip

"To test AWS Lambda with Docker locally, you need to use the AWS Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE). First, ensure that your Docker image is built upon the base AWS Lambda image, specifically `FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10`. 

You can test the setup by running the following command to start a container and expose a local endpoint:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
```

This will start an endpoint locally at `localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations`. You can then send a POST request to this endpoint using curl. Here’s an example:

For Windows:
```bash
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d ""{\""url\"": \""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg\""}""

For Unix:
```bash
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{""url"": ""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg""}'

"If you are unable to run `pip install tflite_runtime` from GitHub wheel links, you can try the following solutions:

1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure you are using a compatible Python version. tflite_runtime does not run on Python 3.10, so consider installing Python 3.9.

2. **Find Compatible Wheel**: Visit the following link to check for available versions that match your operating system and Python version: [tflite-runtime](https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/). If you don't find a suitable version, check the GitHub repository for pre-built binaries: [tflite-aws-lambda](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite).

3. **Directly Install Wheel**: Download the appropriate `.whl` file to your project folder and install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install <file-name>
   ```

4. **Use Docker or Virtual Machine**: If the above solutions do not work, you might want to run your code in a Docker container or on a virtual machine with a Linux operating system. You can use platforms like Vertex AI Workbench on Google Cloud to create a suitable environment.

"If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, here are some possible workarounds:

1. Downgrade the protobuf package to version 3.20.x or lower.
2. Set the environment variable PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION to ""python"", although this will use pure-Python parsing, which is much slower.

"To solve the issue of running out of storage after building many Docker images, you should follow these steps:

1. Use the command `docker images` to check the images currently stored on your system and identify any superseded or duplicate models taking up space.
2. Remove the unwanted Docker images using `docker rmi <image_id>` for each image you wish to delete.
3. After removing the images, it’s important to free up the storage space that these images were occupying. To do this, run the command `docker system prune`. This command will help free up the storage that you might expect to recover by simply deleting images.

Remember, deleting Docker images alone does not free up space until you also perform a system prune.","Problem description

"Emails in the peer review process for projects are hashed using the SHA-1 algorithm. To compute the hash value of your email address, you can use the following Python code:

```python
from hashlib import sha1
def compute_hash(email):
    return sha1(email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
```

You need to replace `""YOUR_EMAIL_HERE""` with your actual email address and run the code to obtain the hashed email.

Marcos MJD",236864c2,What causes pickle to throw an attribute error when running a Docker container with waitress?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"The reason pickle works with Flask but not with waitress for your custom column transformer class is due to how the class is referenced in different contexts. When you save the model using pickle, it references the class in the global namespace as `__main__.<custom_class>`. This works in Flask because Flask runs the script where the class is defined in the `__main__` context.

However, when you use waitress, it loads the application from a different module, which does not have the `__main__` namespace containing the custom class. As a result, pickle cannot find the class and throws an error. 

The solution is to place the custom column transformer class in a separate module that can be imported both in the script that saves the model and in the script that loads it. This ensures that the class is correctly referenced regardless of whether Flask or waitress is used.","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.

"To convert the `day_of_the_month` and `month_of_the_year` columns into a single `day_of_the_year` column in pandas, you can follow these steps:

1. Convert the `day_of_the_month` column from integer type to string type:
   ```python
   df['day_of_the_month'] = df['day_of_the_month'].map(str)
   ```

2. Convert the `month_of_the_year` column (which contains strings like 'jan', 'feb', etc.) into corresponding month numbers as strings:
   ```python
   month_mapping = {'jan': '1', 'feb': '2', 'mar': '3', 'apr': '4', 'may': '5', 'jun': '6', 
                    'jul': '7', 'aug': '8', 'sep': '9', 'oct': '10', 'nov': '11', 'dec': '12'}
   df['month'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map(month_mapping)
   ```

   ```python
   df['date_formatted'] = pd.to_datetime(
       dict(
           year='2055',
           month=df['month'],

"To transform 'month_of_the_year' values like 'jan' and 'feb' into integers in pandas, you can use the `map()` function to convert the string representations of the months into their corresponding integers. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Use `map()` to convert 'jan', 'feb', ..., 'dec' into 1, 2, ..., 12.
2. Combine this with the day of the month to create a datetime object.
3. Finally, extract the day of the year from this datetime object.

Here’s a simplified example based on the provided context:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'day_of_the_month': [1, 2, 20, 25],
    'month_of_the_year': ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr']
})

# Convert day of the month to string
df['day_of_the_month'] = df['day_of_the_month'].map(str)

# Map month strings to integers
month_mapping = {'jan': 1, 'feb': 2, 'mar': 3, 'apr': 4, 'may': 5, 'jun': 6, 
                 'jul': 7, 'aug': 8, 'sep': 9, 'oct': 10, 'nov': 11, 'dec': 12}
df['month'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map(month_mapping)

# Create datetime from day and month
df['date_formatted'] = pd.to_datetime(
    dict(
        year='2055',  # Example year
        month=df['month'],
        day=df['day_of_the_month']
    )
)

# Get day of the year
df['day_of_year'] = df['date_formatted'].dt.dayofyear
```

In this example, the 'month_of_the_year' values are successfully transformed into integers corresponding to their month numbers.","Problem description: I have one column day_of_the_month .

"To format day and month columns into a datetime object using pandas, you can follow these steps:

1. Convert the `day_of_the_month` column from int to str:
   ```python
   df['day_of_the_month'] = df['day_of_the_month'].map(str)
   ```

2. Convert the `month_of_the_year` column (with values like 'jan', 'feb', etc.) into corresponding month numbers as strings (1, 2, ..., 12):
   ```python
   df['month'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map({'jan': '1', 'feb': '2', 'mar': '3', 'apr': '4', 'may': '5', 'jun': '6', 'jul': '7', 'aug': '8', 'sep': '9', 'oct': '10', 'nov': '11', 'dec': '12'})
   ```

3. Create a datetime object with the formatted day and month:
   ```python
   df['date_formatted'] = pd.to_datetime(
       dict(
           year='2055',  # You can specify any year you like
           month=df['month'],
           day=df['day_of_the_month']

   )
   ```

4. If you need to get the day of the year, you can then add:

"You can find help for uploading datasets on Kaggle by following the steps outlined in the context for using Kaggle with Saturn Cloud. Here’s a summary of the process:

1. Install the Kaggle package in your notebook by running: 
   ```bash
   !pip install -q kaggle
   ```

2. Go to the Kaggle website (you'll need to have an account), click on your profile image, and navigate to Account settings. 

3. Scroll down to the API box, click on ""Create New API token,"" which will download a `kaggle.json` file to your local computer.

4. Upload the `kaggle.json` file into the `.kaggle` folder in your notebook environment.

5. Change the permissions of the `kaggle.json` file using:
   ```bash
   !chmod 600 /home/jovyan/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

6. To download a dataset, use the command:
   ```bash
   !kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-name>
   ```

7. Finally, create a folder to unzip your files and unzip them using:
   ```bash
   !mkdir data
   !unzip <dataset-file-name>.zip -d data
   ```

This method will allow you to access all Kaggle datasets directly in your environment.","Install Nvidia drivers: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx.

"The order is important in matrix multiplication because changing the order of the matrices usually results in matrices of different sizes and different values. Specifically, multiplying matrix A (m x n) by matrix B (n x p) yields a matrix C (m x p), while multiplying B (n x p) by A (m x n) results in a different matrix D (n x n). Therefore, the sequence in which the matrices are multiplied affects both the dimensions and the resulting values of the output matrix.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)
B (n x p) * A (m x n) = D (n x n)
C and D are matrices of different sizes and usually have different values. Therefore the order is important in matrix multiplication and changing the order changes the result.
Baran Akın",59b4324f,Why is the order important in matrix multiplication?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"When changing the order in matrix multiplication, the result will be different. The order is important because multiplying matrix A (m x n) by matrix B (n x p) gives a matrix C (m x p), while multiplying matrix B (n x p) by matrix A (m x n) gives a different matrix D (n x n). Since C and D are matrices of different sizes and usually contain different values, changing the order of multiplication changes the result.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

Baran Akın",59b4324f,What happens if I change the order in matrix multiplication?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"The size of the resulting matrix changes with the order of multiplication. Specifically, when multiplying two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix will have dimensions defined by the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix. For example, if you have matrices A (m x n) and B (n x p), multiplying them as A * B results in a matrix C (m x p). However, if you reverse the order and multiply B * A, the resulting matrix D will have dimensions (n x n). Thus, the order of multiplication affects both the size and the values of the resulting matrices.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)
B (n x p) * A (m x n) = D (n x n)

Baran Akın",59b4324f,How does the size of the resulting matrix change with the order of multiplication?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"No, multiplying matrices in a different order does not produce the same result. The order of multiplication is important in matrix multiplication; changing the order changes the result and typically produces matrices of different sizes and values.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)

Baran Akın",59b4324f,Can multiplying matrices in a different order produce the same result?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"An example illustrating the impact of changing the order in matrix multiplication is as follows:

Let matrix A be of size m x n and matrix B be of size n x p. When we multiply them in the order A * B, we obtain a resulting matrix C of size m x p. However, if we change the order and multiply B * A instead, we get a different resulting matrix D of size n x n. Since C and D are matrices of different sizes, they will usually contain different values as well.

"To set up a Conda environment on your computer, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Anaconda or Miniconda**: If you don’t have either installed, you should install it first.

2. **Create the Environment**: Run the command `conda create -n ml-zoomcamp python=3.9` (or replace `3.9` with `3.8` or `3.10` if you prefer a different version).

3. **Activate the Environment**: After the environment is created, you just need to run `conda activate ml-zoomcamp` whenever you want to use it.

4. **Export Environment (optional)**: You can export your existing environment to a YAML file using `conda env export > environment.yml`. This allows you to reproduce your environment later with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

"No, it is not necessarily best to train a model only on the most important features. While some features may be more important than others, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included in the model. It is suggested to predict with and without including specific features, and if excluding a feature drops performance, it should be kept; otherwise, it can be dropped. Moreover, features that seem individually important might be highly correlated with others, so including a broader set of features could be beneficial. Feature selection algorithms can also be explored to aid in this process.","I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?
Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine.

Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
